# [Tic-Tac-Toe Game](https://tic-tac-toe-game-sidd.vercel.app/)

A simple and interactive Tic-Tac-Toe game built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Two players can play against each other on the same device, with a win count feature and the ability to reset the game. The game also alternates the starting player after each game ends.

## Features

- **Two-player game**: Play against another player locally.
- **Win tracking**: The win count for both Player X and Player O is displayed and updated after each game.
- **Game restart**: After each game (win or tie), the game will automatically restart, with the starting player alternating between Player X and Player O.
- **Responsive design**: The game interface is responsive and works on different screen sizes.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: Markup for the game interface.
- **CSS**: Styling the layout and design of the game.
- **JavaScript**: Game logic, win detection, and player alternation.

## How to Play

1. **Player X** and **Player O** take turns clicking on the grid to place their mark (X or O).
2. The game automatically checks for a win or a tie.
3. After the game ends (either with a win or a tie), it will automatically restart after a short delay, and the starting player will switch.
4. The win count for each player is updated and displayed next to their respective name.
